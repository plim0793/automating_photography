# Generating High-Quality Photographs from Videos

## Overview
Taking good photographs is a hard task for most people, so what if there was a easier method of generating good photographs?  With the rise of video clips as a medium for social media (Snapchat, Instagram, etc), taking static images is not as necessary anymore.  Using video clips and analyzing them frame-by-frame, this deep learning neural network can detect basic photographic techniques and capture the best frames it sees.

Here is the YouTube video demonstrating the Flask app implementation.

## How to Use

The model.py file can be run from terminal.  Edit the global variables within the file to fine tune the parameters to fit the video file.  The modeling.ipynb file can be used to run certain portions of the modeling code for troubleshooting and editing to fit your need.
